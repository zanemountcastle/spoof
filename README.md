MAC Address Spoof

Spoof is a simple Bash script that allows the user to easily change their computer’s existing MAC address to a randomly generated MAC address. 

Purpose

Spoof allows for easy circumventing of timeout-based internet services in airports, cafes, etc. With a new MAC address, the internet provider recognises the ‘spoofed’ computer as a new user thereby allowing it to immediately reconnect to the internet.

This script has been tested in numerous Starbucks coffee shops, Barcelona International Airport (BCN) and Dubai International Airport (DXB).

Compatibility

	•	Mac OS X 10+

Installation

In the ~./spoof/modules, run the following command: 

chmod +x spoof.sh
./spoof.sh

Happy surfing!
